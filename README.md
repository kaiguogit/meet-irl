# Fictional Employee Directory to practice Karma and Jasmine with AngularJS
- [Following Adam Morgan's scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/testing-angularjs-with-jasmine-and-karma-part-1)

## Getting Started
- $ npm install
- $ npm start

## Built with
- AngularJS, Node.js, Express.js, Jasmine, Karma, Yarn, Babel, Gulp.

## Acknowledgments
- Adam Morgan, Scotch.io

## Notes
- When we're using Jasmine to test our code we group our tests together with what Jasmine calls a "test suite". We begin our test suite by calling Jasmine's global describe function. This function takes two parameters: a string and a function. The string serves as a title and the function is the code that implements our tests.
